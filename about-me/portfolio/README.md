# Portfolio

I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Comparative Human Development. 

I am a social science researcher with industry experience in technical writing, content strategy, copywriting, user research, and web development. While learning qualitative and quantitative research methods in cultural anthropology classes, I became interested in accessibility, localization, and diversity/inclusion. 

I am a technical writer at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) in San Francisco, CA. Previously, I was a technical writer at [Cisco AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/) and a UX content strategist at [Vinebase](https://vinebase.com/).
