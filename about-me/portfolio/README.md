# Portfolio

I am a social science researcher with industry experience in technical writing, content strategy, copywriting, user research, and web development. Studying qualitative and quantitative research methods in cultural anthropology made me passionate about accessibility, localization, and diversity/inclusion. 

I am currently a technical writer at Datadog in San Francisco, CA. Previously, I was a technical/UX writer at AppDynamics.
