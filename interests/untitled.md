# Onboarding & Remote Working

**AppDynamics**

#### 2021

Since two new hires on the Information Development team started in November 2020, I have been mentoring these individuals by scheduling weekly check-ins, troubleshooting questions about the New Writer's Checklist, and hosting trainings on Confluence, Jira, Snagit, Outlook, and Zendesk.

#### 2020

My first day at Cisco AppDynamics was March 23, the week San Francisco went on lockdown. I was the first technical writer in the Information Development team to onboard remotely and luckily, I had my computer and phone already configured with Cisco identity and device management services. I set up weekly check-ins with my manager and technical writing mentor, who walked me through the New Writer's Checklist, trainings, and my first major product release!

* I formatted the New Writer's Checklist into an actual checklist with macros in Confluence, updated the content to reflect a work-from-home onboarding experience, and fixed broken images/links.
* I conducted a consistency review across several doc sets with a checklist of topics from the Docs Style Guide and piloted a peer review process per product release.
* I published release notes, updated product documentation, and closed out release tickets in July!

#### **2019**

At Cisco, I was the sole member of the Digital Workplace Transformation team working in San Jose and the rest of my team was spread across New Mexico, San Diego, and RTP. 

My team worked cross-functionally with security engineers and change managers in London, Australia, and Tel Aviv, and Iâ€™m grateful that my morning calls were never too early for me in California \(7:30 AM at the earliest\). 

I learned to be patient, document everything, and proactively communicate to ensure that my stakeholders were all in sync. I was mentored by two User Experience Researchers who introduced me to the world of user experience design, writing, and copy. 

* I wrote onboarding guides, email communications, and laptop provisioning instructions for new hires. 
* I provided UX copy feedback on screen mockups, landing pages, and design prototypes.
* I transcribed group interviews, prepared research presentations, and designed surveys in Verint.
