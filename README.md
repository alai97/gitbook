# Introduction

Hello! my name is Austin Lai.

I'm a technical writer, UX content strategist, and content designer living in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019 and moved into the city at the start of quarantine \(around March 2020\). 

Since [college](https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/uncommon-blog/adulting-in-college), I have enjoyed recipe testing, aromatherapy, and gardening in my apartment in the Lower Haight. I really love indoor plants -- my snake plant recently propagated a new baby!
