# Introduction

Hello, my name is Austin Lai.

I'm a technical writer, UX content strategist, and content designer living in San Francisco, CA.

Since graduating [college](https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/uncommon-blog/adulting-in-college) and returning to the Bay Area after culinary school in London, I've enjoyed recipe testing, aromatherapy, and gardening in my apartment in the Lower Haight. I serve as the Communications Chair for the [UChicago Alumni Club of the Bay Area](https://alumniandfriends.uchicago.edu/s/community?clubGroupName=Alumni+Club+of+the+Bay+Area) and a Contributing Member of the [UChicago Alumni Pride](https://alumniandfriends.uchicago.edu/s/community?clubGroupName=UChicago%20Alumni%20Pride) affinity group.&#x20;

I love candles, house plants, and wineâ€”my favorite candle right now is [Grapefruit + Mangosteen](https://www.basikcandle.com/collections/candles/products/grapefruit-mangosteen-candle) from Basik, a small San Francisco producer. I have a baby snake plant and dream of owning a thick-stemmed Monstera one day! &#x20;

On the weekend, you can find me at Arizmendi Bakery, Omnivore Bookstore, or Barry's in Castro.&#x20;
