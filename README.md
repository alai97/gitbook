# Introduction

Hello! My name is Austin Lai.

I'm a technical writer, UX content strategist, and content designer living in San Francisco, CA. I graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.A. in Comparative Human Development and moved into the city the week before quarantine \(around March 2020\). 

Since graduating [college](https://collegeadmissions.uchicago.edu/uncommon-blog/adulting-in-college) and returning to the Bay Area after culinary school in London, I've enjoyed recipe testing, aromatherapy, and gardening in my apartment in the Lower Haight. I love candles and indoor plants -- my snake plant recently propagated a new baby! Prior to quarantine, you could find me at Arizmendi Bakery, Dolores Park, or Barry's in the Castro.
